            Hello! My name is Maham and I enjoy using data to build products, and to create products that enable users to harness the power of data. My data journey formally began at the NYU Gallatin School of Individualized Study, where I had the privelege of designing my own Master's program, bringing together data science, urban analytics, philosophy and ethics.
        </p>
        <p>I'm obsessed with using data to build products that people love. Currently, I'm focused on making data skills accessible to everyone as a Senior Data Science Content Developer at <a href="https://datacamp.com/instructors/mahamfaisalkhan" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>.</p> 

        <p>
            Fast forward to today, and I've had the opportunity to found my own experimental start-up at grad school, work at a data science lab in an international organization, a huge e-commerce giant selling a zillion things home, and an edTech scale-up. 
        </p>
        <p>
            At the moment, I work on an incredible team that's on a mission to democratize access to data skills. <a href="https://datacamp.com/instructors/mahamfaisalkhan" target="_blank">Learn</a> all about how I'm working to bring ten million registered learners the latest and greatest in AI and data science!
        </p>

            <p> 
                I'm obsessed with the idea of using data to inform the design of delightful products. Talk to me about data-driven product design!
